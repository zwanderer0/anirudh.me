IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES
===========================================

1. ALWAYS PULL FIRST
   git pull --no-rebase origin master
   The site may have been updated via CMS or another computer.
   Skipping this WILL cause conflicts or lost work.

2. REPO STRUCTURE
   Root directory = live site (GitHub Pages serves from /)
   hugo-blog/     = blog source (markdown posts, theme, config)
   blog/          = built blog output (generated by Hugo, do not edit directly)
   assets/        = fonts and images
   css/, js/      = site stylesheets and scripts
   projects/      = project pages

3. TO EDIT THE MAIN SITE
   Edit HTML/CSS/JS files at the repo root.

4. TO WRITE A BLOG POST
   See HOW-TO-WRITE-NEW-BLOG-POSTS.txt for full instructions.
   Short version:
   - Create markdown in hugo-blog/content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
   - Put images in hugo-blog/static/images/<slug>/
   - Rebuild: cd hugo-blog && hugo --baseURL="https://anirudh.me/blog/" --destination="../blog/" --cleanDestinationDir
   - git add, commit, push

5. AFTER EVERY CHANGE
   git add <changed files>
   git commit -m "Description of change"
   git push origin master
   Site goes live in ~1-2 minutes.

6. IF PUSH IS REJECTED
   git pull --no-rebase origin master
   Then push again.

7. CMS (VISUAL EDITOR)
   https://anirudh.me/blog/admin/
   Requires GitHub PAT. For text-only edits from any device.

8. DO NOT DELETE
   blog/        — this is the live blog
   hugo-blog/   — this is the blog source
   assets/      — these are the site images and fonts
   CLAUDE.md    — coding agent instructions

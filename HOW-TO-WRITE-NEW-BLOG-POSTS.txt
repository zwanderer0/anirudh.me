HOW TO WRITE NEW BLOG POSTS — anirudh.me/blog/
================================================

1. FILE & FRONTMATTER
---------------------
Create a markdown file in hugo-blog/content/posts/ named:
  YYYY-MM-DD-slug-of-post-title.md

Start the file with this frontmatter:
  ---
  title: "Your Post Title Here"
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  draft: false
  slug: "slug-of-post-title"
  ---

The slug determines the URL: anirudh.me/blog/slug-of-post-title/
Set draft: true to preview without publishing.


2. IMAGES
---------
Put images in: hugo-blog/static/images/<post-slug>/
  Example: hugo-blog/static/images/ai-kiran/anirudh-speaking.jpg

Resize before adding (originals are often 10-17MB):
  sips --resampleWidth 1200 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 85 \
    "source.jpg" --out hugo-blog/static/images/<post-slug>/output.jpg

Target: ~1200px wide, JPEG quality 85, under 300KB each.
GIFs are fine for animations (keep under 600KB).

In markdown, reference images as:
  ![Descriptive alt text](/blog/images/<post-slug>/filename.jpg)

The path MUST start with /blog/images/ (not the static/ filesystem path).


3. WRITING STYLE (Anirudh's Voice)
-----------------------------------
- First person, reflective. Open with a scene or personal memory.
- Conversational but intellectually rigorous. Assume reader intelligence.
- Name people by full name with links. Use first names after.
- Ground ideas in place and time. Mention cities, years, events.
- Varied sentence rhythm. Short punchy + longer flowing.
- Use ## section headings. ### for subsections in longer posts.
- Images woven into narrative, placed after the paragraph they relate to.
- End open-ended. A question or forward thought, not a summary.
- AVOID: em dashes, hashtags, "stay tuned", "In this post I will",
  or any AI-sounding patterns. No "In conclusion."
- Links inline: [Project Name](https://url.com/) within sentences.


4. POST STRUCTURE (Typical)
---------------------------
1. Opening (~150 words): Personal anecdote or scene
2. Context (~100 words): What/where/when/who, with links
3. Body (~400 words): Walk through subject, name people, ### subsections
4. Closing (~100 words): Reflection, open question, forward-looking


5. PREVIEW LOCALLY
------------------
  cd hugo-blog/
  hugo server --baseURL="http://localhost:1313/blog/" -D

Open the URL shown in terminal (port may vary if 1313 is in use).


6. BUILD & DEPLOY
-----------------
Step 1 - Build with production URLs:
  cd hugo-blog && hugo --baseURL="https://anirudh.me/blog/" \
    --destination="../blog/" --cleanDestinationDir

Step 2 - Pull first (GitHub Actions may have pushed):
  git pull --no-rebase origin master

Step 3 - Stage source + built output + images:
  git add hugo-blog/content/posts/<post-file>.md
  git add hugo-blog/static/images/<post-slug>/
  git add blog/

Step 4 - Commit and push:
  git commit -m "Blog post: Your Post Title"
  git push origin master

GitHub Pages deploys in ~1-2 minutes.
If push is rejected, run: git pull --no-rebase origin master
Then push again.


7. VISUAL CMS (Alternative)
----------------------------
Decap CMS editor: anirudh.me/blog/admin/
Requires a GitHub PAT:
  GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens >
  Fine-grained > repo scope on zwanderer0/anirudh.me
Paste token on first visit. GitHub Actions auto-rebuilds after saves.


REFERENCE POST
--------------

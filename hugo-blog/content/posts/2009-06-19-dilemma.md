What would be the best between:

1. pyGE Touch like implementation under SketchUp, doable if SketchUp can support WIN32COM interfacing http://code.google.com/p/pymt/source/browse/examples/kaswy/PyGE_touch.py

2. Going with Aberrant's TUIO Client within SketchUp, we won't continue with it since thread calculation within SketchUp's scripting is quite a pain.

3. Write TUIO to Text/XML, and get it read by SketchUp. That's what we're busy doing now. After this works, we'll work with code refinement and optimizing the stuff before moving to gestures.

Leaning towards option 3 honestly -- it's the least elegant but it actually works without fighting SketchUp's threading limitations. Sometimes jugaad beats the clean solution :P

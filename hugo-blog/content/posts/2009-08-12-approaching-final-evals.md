The "pencils down" date for GSoC is approaching fast. This is the core of the work during this time.

**1**. Code cleaning. Decided to keep the previous ruby tuio client experiments' work safe in the repository (pre-midterms GSoC work). It might be useful in the future development where better and refined gestures might be inculcated.

**2**. Code commenting wherever necessary

**3**. Documentation's skeleton done

   3.a) Compile HowTo's
   3.b) Readme's
   3.c) Changelog
   3.d) Etc.

It's been one crazy summer. GSoC taught me more than 3 years of college coursework -- dealing with real code, real mentors, real deadlines. Pawel and the NUIGroup community made it all possible. The plugin isn't perfect but it works, and I know the multitouch+CAD space is going to blow up in the coming years. For now, cleanup and docs. The hacking doesn't stop here :-)

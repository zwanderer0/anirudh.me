The morning of AI Kiran, Lesley Ray was still fixing her BrainHome prototype. Cables, sensor arrays, a laptop that wouldn't talk to the controller board. I watched her troubleshoot with the same calm panic I recognized from my own past. In 2013, I was an [INK](https://www.inktalks.com/) Fellow in Kochi. The night before I was supposed to present on the main stage, I was in my hotel room with my carbon pollution ink prototype in pieces, trying to get the filtration layer to hold. That's Physical AI. There are no clean deploys. It's machines and systems and soldering irons and things that refuse to boot five minutes before you go on. That's what makes it real.

[Raji Kannan](https://www.ck12.org/) pulled me into organizing this. She's a friend from MIT Media Lab days, and when Raji calls, you say yes.

## What is AI Kiran

AI Kiran, "kiran" meaning ray of light, took place at the Consulate General of India in San Francisco. We organized it with [INK Foundation](https://www.inktalks.com/) and Lakshmi Pratury. The idea was simple. A "demo or die" gathering for Physical AI. Not another panel about LLMs and benchmarks. Bring things you can touch, hear, feel. Show, don't tell.

The MIT Media Lab coined "demo or die" as an alternative to academia's "publish or perish." You had to show a working demo. Not a slide deck. Not a paper. A thing.

## The evening

### Tejas Rode and Petika

The evening opened with live music. Tejas plays the Petika, a digital microtonal harmonium he built to preserve the Agra Gharana tradition of Indian classical music. A lineage going back centuries. The instrument itself is new, but the music it carries is ancient. Tabla accompaniment, a singer in a pink sari. The Consulate's formal conference room, with its Indian and American flags standing side by side, transformed into something else entirely.

### Navya Veeturi and WYWA

[WYWA](https://www.wywa.co/) is wildfire detection through chemical sensing. Edge AI sensors that smell, see, and detect fires before they spread. Real hardware deployed in real forests. Not a simulation. Navya walked through the full chain on stage: small ignition, see smoke, alert the right people. The kind of work where getting it wrong means acres burn.

### Lesley Ray and BrainHome

Environmental health intelligence. Calibrating your home environment, light, air, sound, for cognitive wellness. Hardware prototypes, sensor arrays, all the things that were giving her trouble that morning. She got it working. She always does.

### Raji Kannan

Raji presented KIBA, a CES Innovation Award-winning robot. She also curated the student exhibition that ran alongside the main demos. Raji runs [CK-12](https://www.ck12.org/), providing free K-12 educational resources to millions. The combination of frontier robotics and K-12 education is very her.

### Arvind Sanjeev and Ghostwriter

[Ghostwriter](https://arvindsanjeev.com/ghostwriter.html) is a typewriter that writes on its own, powered by GPT-3. The irony of channeling the most advanced language model through the oldest writing interface. Arvind's work lives at the intersection of art and technology, and this piece captures that tension perfectly. The keystrikes are loud. The room goes quiet when it starts typing.

### Rainier Labs and Terrier

A [Terrier](https://www.rainierlabs.com/) robot dog walking through the demo area. People stepping back, phones out. Metallic green body, motion blur on the legs. Demo or die in its most literal form.

### The demo floor

The in-between moments were my favorite part. People holding chai and plates of food while a robotic arm moved on the table next to them. Students showing projects Raji had curated. Navya's WYWA poster on the wall. Conversations that only happen when there's something physical to point at.

## The panel

Supriya Gujral, Deepak Ramola ([BlueRobins](https://www.bluerobins.in/)), Arvind Sanjeev, and Dinoop Dayanand sat in the Consulate's library for a conversation about where Physical AI goes from here. The discussion kept returning to a gap: what gets funded is software, but what changes lives is often things in the physical world. Education, access, the distance between a working prototype and a product that reaches people.

## Why this matters

Most of what we call AI today lives inside screens. But the breakthroughs that changed my own life were physical. [LeChal](https://anirudh.me/projects/lechal/) shoes that vibrate to navigate the visually impaired. [AIR-INK](https://anirudh.me/projects/air-ink/) that captures vehicular pollution and turns it into ink. Those weren't software updates. They were things you could hold.

The "kiran" in AI Kiran is these people. Makers who bring AI into the world you can touch. And as I watched Lesley present flawlessly that evening on the same hardware she was rewiring that morning, I thought about how that's always been the real test. Not whether your demo works in the lab. Whether it works when it matters.

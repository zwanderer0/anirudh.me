I am waiting to see what happens to the indigenous Notion Ink Adam and Apple iPad. Will it even turn out to be a war? Both are not released yet- but the coming summer isn't far away too. Should i quote "breathless anticipation usually reserved by nubile nymphets for rakish rockers." :-P

*The Notion Ink Adam tablet with its Pixel Qi display*

Adam beats iPad hands down in all hardware specs. The hardware, the software ( Yay! Android and Ubuntu combo is superawesome) but yes we know of the Apple's marketing strategies.

Remember how the tech-blogs like engadget, gizmodo and macrumours assured that the Apple iPod will be a failure! Lmao! It took over the walk-man. Portable music is somewhat defined by it! Let's see how Apple and Adam fare in terms of Tablets. I am seriously not interested in HP-Slate running Windoze 7, as per the leaked specs on gizmodo :D

Adam touted on its website about them releasing their own SDK. Following thoughts and questions pop-up:

- It'll run Ubuntu and Android whose SDKs pre-exist. What has Notion Ink got to with realesing their own SDK ? Can someone clear this up for me :=)

- Features, yep, Adam has a lots of them? But Apple has shown in past that mearly packing a device with features doesn't make it successful. Looking at iPods and iPhones show that its not the number of features packed into one, its the overall design and vision. lol! The Chinese Phone selling out in street marts has more features jampacked than anything. Need I say more? :-D

Looks great at the moment, but this just brings up more questions. Mostly questions about the screen, but also the positioning of the touchpad on the back of the device. Add to it, Keeping it one the back will require lesser movement on hand while you hold it!

I am using a N900 lately. And yea! Maemo seems to have all the features we'd expect on a device rolled out by Nokia, and it is in all true *definitions open source*.

If Nokia continue to develop maemo to have the basic features of an iPhone, it'll take over the world. Till now they've not been able to.

Oh and yes! Maemo stuff does proper multi-tasking, unlike the iPad by Apple or the iPhone. Its still un-understandable to me why Apple thought that it was OK to release a device like that without it. Even Windows 2.0 had some kind of pseudo multi-tasking. Apple has its own style of winning. period. Mix of thoughts :-P

Back to the NI thing. Just realized the Pixel Qi was the screen tech featured in pop-sci some time ago. Wonderful to see something from that magazine that is actually seeing some use (and some very exciting tech at that).

So I'll say NI, win win win. Please win! This is sublime, if it is as promised.

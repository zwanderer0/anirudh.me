the missing airplane shows that whatever futuristic things we might develop, its important to be in the present(+3 seconds to avoid maybe a dangerous cat to attack you).

we propose technologies that 'would touch lives' 50 years ahead, and forget to live in/for the present. either we're too much altruistic or just too busy in the rat race of inventing a future that we don't know what will be good for. after all these inventions and industries, has the world become a happier place? Not sure. Yes, we definitely have gotten many superhuman powers now, but the fact everyone has those powers keeps us pushing for inventing even more.

--- pause---

for a moment, lets be in the moment, and thank nature at times for it has conspired till this very moment--that we are.

I can't even begin to count the number of sensors/technologies that plane had. One in all, so many lives, so many stories. All have become one with nature now. In split second.

At times have you wondered, that outside that .5 feet plastic wall is pure destruction--juxtaposed to our belief/realisation--as the beautiful airhostess asks us which wine we'd fancy and we're complaining how low resolution the LCDs are.

Right beyond that half a feet of plastic/metal lies a dance of death, that'll freeze your blood, in 5 seconds. Realize?

I dont want to scare you, or myself, so I'll stop. I'll drink some green-tea now and leave for my lab. I have those inventions to do.

RIP all victims of Flight 370.

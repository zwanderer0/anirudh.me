I am witing this post from my dark room in Cambridge. As dark when ut was back in bikaner. 

The journey to MIT might sound interesting. Makeover when when I went to a very normal local engineering college in rural India. I'll share some of the key moments of remembrance,  fun, mistakes and life lessons.

The good student, bad student distinctions which play a major role in Indian education system. Lets call them GS and BS.

Till the age of 18 when I wrote my tenth board exams everything was fine. Much To parents' delight and neighbours jealousy I used to score around 90 percent marks, run after olympiad, NTS certificates and quiz.  A regular definition of the GS was being met. However I was missing out on life. No sports, no outdoors, zeroism.

The voyeur of youth kicked in, I made friends with the bad but smart kids of the class.

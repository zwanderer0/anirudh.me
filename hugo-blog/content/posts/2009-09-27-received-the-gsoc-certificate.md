Finally I got my GSoC certificate of completion. Huge thanks to my mentor Pawel Solyga(solydzajs) and Google Open Source Programs Office.

The Fedex shipping had twisted and crumpled and torn it a bit on the way from Googleplex to Delhi, a little trick called "lamination" helped it look as good as a new one ( atleast in the scanned image below). yay!

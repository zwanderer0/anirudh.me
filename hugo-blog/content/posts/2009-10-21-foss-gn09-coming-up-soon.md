We've planned a FOSS event in college from 28-31st October. We'll be talking to people about enhancing their contribution to the commnity, code, and the spirit behind.

Probably we'll be having [Niyam Bhushan](http://www.niyam.com/). So we'll be talking and doing an unconference on Human Computer Interaction, Multitouch, programming gestures, why a programmer should consider design while writing code etc. We've also planned to do a hackfest on how to build a DIY multitouch table with junk hardware etc. and writing some gestures code in AS3

Other planned talks are about the future internet and Disaster management using Sahana (by skbohra), etc.

Detailed plan can be seen here in the brochure that I designed yesterday :-)

Quite a long time since we didn't show our work done in pre-summer-holidays time at IIT delhi's Design lab. Here's a sneak peek into the multitouch wall done by Sparsh team during their IIT Delhi stay.

Hail NUI :) The upcoming video will show some custom applications with object marking.

Building the wall at IIT Delhi's design lab was proper jugaad -- we sourced a projector, an acrylic sheet, IR LEDs, and a PS3 Eye camera, put it all together in a couple of days. The best part was showing it to people who'd never seen multitouch before, their faces when objects on screen responded to their fingers was priceless. Sparsh team putting it together with almost zero budget, that's how we roll :P

![CAD design showing adjustable projector rails and shoe-strip mount](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixnIXXzqxqROHY9v7sLdygjJF_2TP-7gDTGRqO3v2yzYREce55iRfm1BIgHyxHWDe6KSztvVKfCpZdSu3Uk3RKMKydaR7DhMpMBJfDBfM6Gzit4weTD1NY5iDTkSc4uFIcElH2RsH0CJG7/s1600/sparsh.jpg)

The problem we faced: We experimented with a variety of Projectors from the college's computer lab, we found Mitsubishi XD490u fitting best to our 16:9 needs and the setup alignment. However, we couldn't afford it, so had to get it issued from the Computer Science engineering Dept. of our college. Although college projector couldn't be availed everytime we need to present the table outside the campus, so we got a task at hand: Making the Multitouch table in a manner that any projector could fit up neatly inside.

See the rails in green, now any fitted in projector can move to and fro, forward-backward (n-1 degrees of freedom) . The yellow base supports the projector using a shoe-strip holder. Good thing! we could now fit in any projector we wanted to :-)

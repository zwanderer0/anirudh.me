- make a toolbar and User Interface for the plugin
- Figure out how the overlay circular menu will work on SketchUp-> This could pop open after someone makes a NUI swish(~) gesture.

The circular menu part is what's keeping me up at night. On a multitouch surface you don't have a right-click, so you need some gesture to trigger the menu -- and it has to feel natural, not forced. Trying a few things out, will post screenshots when something clicks.

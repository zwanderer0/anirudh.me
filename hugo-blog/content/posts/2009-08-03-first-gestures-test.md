That's how our first gestures tests came out as using TUIO simulator. The BSR watermark is from the ahh! propietary screen recorder software. Why isn't it Open Source!

The good news -- basic rotate and zoom gestures are working with the TUIO simulator input. The not-so-good news -- there's noticeable lag between the gesture and SketchUp responding, the XML file read approach has its limits. But hey, the model actually moves when you pinch and twist on screen, that first moment was a mini yay! moment :-) Now to make it buttery smooth..

For the past 4 days I was working with my GSoC project and so far I've been able to do the following except my to successfully let Google SketchUp talk to TUIO.

- Setup the iconset, the UI - that'd enable the enabling and disabling of the extension from SketchUp's toolbar.
- Two operation modes for the plugin SketchUp, B1-Control Navigation B2-Enable Drawing/Sketching
- Trying with TUIO data into SketchUp.

The TUIO part is the tricky bit -- just wish that the Google SketchUp's API was a little more developer friendly.. but that's what makes it fun to hack around. Slowly getting somewhere :-)

Duh! Long overdue for this post. Almost 500 students attended the FOSS Fest during [Sakshama](http://www.sakshama.org/) :-) Mostly undergrad prefinal and final year engineering students. We started barely 20 days before and managed to finish everything right in time! quickfire way :-)

Most of us wishfully had almost none or less than 2-3 hours of sleep for the 3 days of the event, it was fun!

Reason: The days were reserved for the FOSS talks, and the mid-nights for Hands-on DIY sessions.

Thanks to: [Leslie](http://www.hawthornlandings.org/) and [Ellen](http://atlantalinuxfest.org/node/73) from Google Open Source Office, [Rahul Sundaram](http://rahulsundaram.livejournal.com/) and [Shankarsan](http://sankarshan.randomink.org/blog/) for Fedora goodies, [Kinshuk](http://www.blogger.com/kinshuksunil.com/) for the help he provided in managing the event, kunal for the t-shirts printing, [skbohra](http://www.geekybuddha.org/), [niyam](http://niyam.com/), paras, [manu](http://manudixit.org/), chits, jdk, [zugard](http://www.blogger.com/zugardmt.wordpress.com) team and all the juniors who worked hard together to make the event success :-)

The experience can't by described in this short sleep deprived post. :-) Till the longer version, a small Flickr Stream of some photographs.

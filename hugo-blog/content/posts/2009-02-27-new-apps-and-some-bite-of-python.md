Well now I am learning actionscript from Scratch and planning to do some Multitouch apps using it. We happen to be fans of the [RotatableScalable Class](http://wiki.nuigroup.com/Rotatablescalable) by NUIGroup, which has some prewritten magic that we can directly extend in our code.

Another thing that deserves a mention is [pyMT](http://code.google.com/p/pymt/), which Sharath introduced us to, who happens to be a bigtime fan of the Python language and contributor this project. He's doing his final year project with his team back there in Mangalore , and hey, pyMT's Python apps look great !

Since I'll be continuing with Actionscript for now, it remains to be seen whether Python or ActionScript is better. :-) Let's wait and watch

**1**. Added a new blogpost (last), regarding my gesture implementation thought.

**2**. The repo had gone erroneous due to cleanup and I faced some issues while using the Merge command. Things are fine now -- fixed by Pawel.

The indented commit message was: "Remove non-required components that came while freezing required filesets. Code commenting and cleaning updations. Adding a Readme for Current Status and project details."

That's the research and work I did yesterday, got an exam in an hour. GSoC + semester exams running in parallel is not for the faint-hearted hehe. Off to cram some OS concepts now, kthxbai.

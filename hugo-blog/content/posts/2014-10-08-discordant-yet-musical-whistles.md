My house in Delhi has a guard that walks around and whistles all night to keep the thieves away. I am still amused by how the entire street comes together and contributes and hires the guard, instead of complaining and waiting for the Govt. to solve their issues, which is slow as heck.

Its like a citizen contributed and distributed parallel police with evolving protocol, when the systems don't work well. Atleast it keeps the societal interaction intact and neighbors talk, which i believe is a good thing--communities being vocal about their issues.

writing this at 3AM while everyone sleeps and guard is awake.

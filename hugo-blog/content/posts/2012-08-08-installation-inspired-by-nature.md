A beautiful idea! in form of an installation. Gives me goosebumps! :)

The way the mechanical parts mimic organic motion -- you can't tell where the engineering ends and nature begins. That's the kind of work that makes me want to run back to the lab and start building something. When machines move like living things, it changes how you feel about them, and that shift in perception is what I think good HCI is really about.

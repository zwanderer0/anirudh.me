After a lot of misery I thought no device is worth respect more than a device. Lol! not true. The reason was my bad home button. right, its the only button on the device.

- I happened to take a sharp swivel knife and pop my iPhone's case open.

![iPhone opened up, showing the corroded grounding strap on the home button](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHC1jEa6zVTVgcoLPjSBlobn_qgLd9IUX2Pq9eX3h2on9VG5rvvbXv8EBnU2sWQz9w9Yj1-Tk-3ow4P3PoP3yVdX_AXOgikJi5yclZUTZ085nIPkwm2_3-2oiKTLiYse4G5TID3_qmWlg7/s1600/IMG_3011.GIF)

The shown grounding strap had rust on it and bent slightly upwards apparently from the pressure of the tightened screw. Upon the whole back's removal, I noticed how the main control board where this tiny grounding strap fastens on to, has a contact ring(the wheatish circle in the pic) somewhat larger in diameter than the hole where the screw fixes in.

Makes good sense that the area where actually the rust had culminated is not sealed to prevent humidity, and the sweat and condensation from getting inside due to carrying it in pockets and or sudden changes in temperature. I've stayed a lot in Rajasthan, hot days and cold nights were so common there!

The task wasn't easy. Emotions, fear, memories, a lot was at razor's edge. Some of the photographs from *operation ripapart.*

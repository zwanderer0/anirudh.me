After modifying the Microsoft Lifecam VX-1000 we were ready for our first test, if we were getting the blobs or not. The first shot went great, we got what we had imagined as seen in the NUI videos. The clean blobs are the heart and soul of every Multi-touch display based on FTIR. The couple of screenshots we took are attached with this post. We were elated!

Now evolution is a slow process, and as humans and smartphone users this evolution to 'not drop things' is going to only happen in a million years. It's easier to redesign bodies/smartphones.

I shattered two phones in the last two years, two screens I got replaced were expensive and quite a hit on the pocket. Humans drop things.

![A shattered smartphone screen -- the most fragile, expensive part](https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/32/72/63590707031895/0/extreme-trick-lets-you-salvage-lcd-from-your-broken-phone-screen.1280x600.jpg)

What I don't understand is that the **screen** is the most sensitive part of the phone yet it shatters easier than a feather. The phone has other parts too--an incomprehensibly well made **PCB, modem, battery, and the casing**.

Observing a smartphone physically:

Now the parts above with respect to screen are packed in this fashion primarily for three reasons: packing, protection and function. The case's job is to protect, the electronics are for function, and fasteners/glues for packing.

It's pretty clear that current design of smartphone fails pretty badly at protection. One of the most expensive parts, the screen (aluminosilicate glass) is just a part that's yet to evolve as a hardened material, or oriented badly so that the most adept human gesture of grasping objects comes with a small false negative that's called dropping.

I also don't like phone cases.

## What if phones were designed as shuttlecocks

## Understanding the beauty of fall

Not that we've played a lot of badminton.  At 108 in Baba's room there's been a shuttlecock hanging on the window. The most beautiful thing to be as an observer in a shuttlecock is the orientation it falls in.

*No matter how you drop it >90 percent of impact will be dampened in the first hit on the ground.*

This primarily happens because of how shuttlecock is made.

![Anatomy of a shuttlecock: cork base and feather skirt](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIK7-oFqsGOWRX-qLhHo2euKs-wRvvLVExk23IpISeo6AlLdy5LU6I4PzooI7B3lsTJrjr1A1zN2gi7c4vls8Mh26EJ1_CPj5WTuekluyAUCmPcMfHSAvCvWDF-UADK_0euM4l9raaoobS/s1600/shuttle-cock-parts.jpg)

If we were to design a shuttlecock where the flexible parts are stiff, it'd still fall as a regular shuttlecock, (considering we use a lightweight material).

Clearly, weight and density distribution is everything here. e.g.

**Task to prototype!**

Let's assume there's a hard block of plastic ABS that we were to 3D print in a way that it's weight distribution(COG) falls through one of the edges- i.e. graded density.

We've to design electronics, and fuse the above components in a way that the phone's weight distribution(COG) falls through one of the edges. That's the only place where you put a bit of padding- instead of carrying a bulky phone case.

Thoughts?

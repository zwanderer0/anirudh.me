With the help of Soy Productions i could get a small demo video. Due to table configuration problems a good recording couldn't be done for now at my end. Soon our multitouch wall will be up and running.

Anyway, This is how camera manipulation would look as of now. Let's see if we come up with new ideas soon.

Task TBD - Make touch sensitive drawing and camera manipulation modes switch to each other. Waiting for friend - Pecan to arrive soon.

The camera manipulation with two fingers feels surprisingly natural -- rotate, zoom, pan all working. Drawing mode needs more love though, the mode switching between navigation and sketching isn't smooth yet. One step at a time. Pecan's going to help test on the big table, that's when we'll really know what holds up and what breaks :-)

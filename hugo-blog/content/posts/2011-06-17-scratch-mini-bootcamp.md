So the scratch bootcamp turned out to be fun during my 14 day break from regular research. We traveled 3 cities, 4 schools, and introduced Scratch Programming environment to 8-12 year old kids. Most kids were first time introduced to programming. The novel drag and drop based looping and the fact that other kids from around the world could re-mix, check out their projects,  excited them into coming up with their own ideas, and build them into something usable. The projects involved animations, adding interactivity, and using sprites. Tapan Sharma(student of class 3rd) volunteered and [shared some of the projects online](http://scratch.mit.edu/users/tappu).

I am highly confident of Scratch as a learning tool, and its induction in our education system, due to its learning-by-doing approach. Watching a kid go from "what is this" to building their own interactive game in two hours -- that's the real demo right there.

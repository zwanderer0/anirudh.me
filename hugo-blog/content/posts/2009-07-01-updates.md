![TUIO messages received in SketchUp's debug console via EventRelay](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgo5mnsgwU962lnhjP1hz-1tnoG1hhPYIvnNdVDz4AvSPiEMQ-o6trtf9W0Fq7zo7WoS5DPQazktHVqy5GzlFiUd60Wrk4tiZSNaYvQ8hbDF0MgbEc_SYRyTxJzChFaTRRDgS2rnh0xva6I/s1600/s+cr.JPG)

1. The TUIO messages are being received by the Debug window within Sketchup when we run the TUIO simulator, see screenshot
2. The Gestures still to be implemented. Still trying to find out what's going to be the best strategy for the same. Whether to emulate the mouse, or to go with macros.

Special thanks to Pecan and his plugin EventRelay, which really proved to be the way to implement the DLL within.

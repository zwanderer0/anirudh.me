Just taking a moment out to dedicate some space from one of the last few days that remain at college. The experience turned out very good, and will always remain with me.

Sad and happy. The nights were busy coding, the days were spent tinkering and building things with whatever we could find. Bikaner gave me everything -- the jugaad, the friendships, the confidence to just try stuff. Onward now.

    <p>Now evolution is a slow process, and as humans and smartphone users this evolution to &rsquo;not drop things&rsquo; is going to only happen in a million years. It&rsquo;s easier to redesign bodies/smartphones.</p>
<p>I shattered two phones in the last two years, two screens I got replaced were expensive and quite a hit on the pocket. Humans drop things.</p>
<p><figure class="entry-figure">
  <img src="https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/32/72/63590707031895/0/extreme-trick-lets-you-salvage-lcd-from-your-broken-phone-screen.1280x600.jpg" alt="A shattered smartphone screen &ndash; the most fragile, expensive part" loading="lazy">

</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is that the <strong>screen</strong> is the most sensitive part of the phone yet it shatters easier than a feather. The phone has other parts too&ndash;an incomprehensibly well made <strong>PCB, modem, battery, and the casing</strong>.</p>
<p>Observing a smartphone physically:</p>
<p><figure class="entry-figure">

</figure>
</p>
<p>Now the parts above with respect to screen are packed in this fashion primarily for three reasons: packing, protection and function. The case&rsquo;s job is to protect, the electronics are for function, and fasteners/glues for packing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that current design of smartphone fails pretty badly at protection. One of the most expensive parts, the screen (aluminosilicate glass) is just a part that&rsquo;s yet to evolve as a hardened material, or oriented badly so that the most adept human gesture of grasping objects comes with a small false negative that&rsquo;s called dropping.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t like phone cases.</p>

<p>Not that we&rsquo;ve played a lot of badminton.  At 108 in Baba&rsquo;s room there&rsquo;s been a shuttlecock hanging on the window. The most beautiful thing to be as an observer in a shuttlecock is the orientation it falls in.</p>
<p><em>No matter how you drop it &gt;90 percent of impact will be dampened in the first hit on the ground.</em></p>

</p>
<p>This primarily happens because of how shuttlecock is made.</p>

</p>
<p>If we were to design a shuttlecock where the flexible parts are stiff, it&rsquo;d still fall as a regular shuttlecock, (considering we use a lightweight material).</p>
<p>Clearly, weight and density distribution is everything here. e.g.</p>
<p><figure class="entry-figure">
  <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBNlZohWNYP8QwlcZ5BIHYQ6PubgTZhOuoKjW7wY6BSYoFAS36WuXWFurPeQJo0g51OMtZa8GM9zoynOZ2cAywbTPMF-5rsxwGMovvNsXR2JsvGNOaON_zhBjWnFA2f_EFQ2qAOwDr0Xlw/s1600/concrete-3d.jpg" alt="3D printed object with graded density distribution (MIT)" loading="lazy">

<p>e.g. This configuration preserves the shape and dimensions, but has density distributed on the side. Photo: MIT</p>
<p><strong>Task to prototype!</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume there&rsquo;s a hard block of plastic ABS that we were to 3D print in a way that it&rsquo;s weight distribution(COG) falls through one of the edges- i.e. graded density.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve to design electronics, and fuse the above components in a way that the phone&rsquo;s weight distribution(COG) falls through one of the edges. That&rsquo;s the only place where you put a bit of padding- instead of carrying a bulky phone case.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

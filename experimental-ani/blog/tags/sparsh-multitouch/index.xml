      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a long time since we didn&amp;rsquo;t show our work done in pre-summer-holidays time at IIT delhi&amp;rsquo;s Design lab. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peek into the multitouch wall done by Sparsh team during their IIT Delhi stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hail NUI :) The upcoming video will show some custom applications with object marking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building the wall at IIT Delhi&amp;rsquo;s design lab was proper jugaad &amp;ndash; we sourced a projector, an acrylic sheet, IR LEDs, and a PS3 Eye camera, put it all together in a couple of days. The best part was showing it to people who&amp;rsquo;d never seen multitouch before, their faces when objects on screen responded to their fingers was priceless. Sparsh team putting it together with almost zero budget, that&amp;rsquo;s how we roll :P&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got our table running at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur&amp;rsquo;s annual technical festival- Techkriti, one of the largest ones in India and voila! got First Prize there :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Number of Teams at the exhibit - 20&#xA;Number of Projects that applied - approx 400&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of hardware including the whole wooden box setup and the large projector had to be shipped around 300 Kilometers from here- and explaining Multitouch/FTIR/NUIGroup to the audience for 3 long days countless number of times. And that paid off well :) with some moolah raking in, well the first prize got us richer by Rs. 30000/- , enough money to let us by the new Lasers and a couple of cameras for a new multitouch setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <p>srishti,</p>
<p>i will not stop you from <em>blabbering</em>. looks like i&rsquo;ve had enough of this as well. cant tolerate being called a lair. joking is one thing but its serious here! my whole day was busy with work and inventing and reading in the lab. so much tired cant tell. </p>
<p>just when i woke up i saw that and it surprised me! thanks to you. anyway you have made a lot my days good. so cant blame for a couple of bad ones. BTW. If you&rsquo;re so awesomely SPYING on tweets about me then listen. Vivek and Kunal slept at 5 AM in the morning. i didnt work much with them, only started. that&rsquo;s why at 8am i had to run. BTW. &ldquo;Mein jo hoon, mein wo **nahi **hoon&rdquo; kehta to bhi tu ladai ka topic bana leti i know very well.</p>
<p>also, knocking at a door when someone is NOT INSIDE the house will NOT bring him out. whether u knock 400 or 4 million times. and you&rsquo;re blaming me for that. its okay. i dont want to fight. you do. you ran from the 100 photo deal, and now you&rsquo;re throwing it all back at me. Its okay miss, if it helps you feel better.</p>
<p>dumping cellphones wont bring peace. the trouble is in the head. dont worry i&rsquo;ll not call you- i respect your decisions. please take good care of yourself and choose a good city to move in.</p>
<p>WONT UTTER ANYMORE NONSENSE! PROMISE. </p>
<p>THANKS FOR LOVELY JANAMASHTMI GIFTS.
this is one mail i&rsquo;m writing totally dried out. not had more than a glass of water since morning or a piece of bread even! but you needn&rsquo;t pity,its okay. i will go eat some idlis now at udpupi.. i feel leeched</p>
<p>-Ani</p>

    <p>Let&rsquo;s begin with what all I tried at my end that <strong>didn&rsquo;t work</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <em>Direct Implementation of Ruby Client within Sketchup</em> - Didn&rsquo;t work due to the Ruby API&rsquo;s limitation under SketchUp.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>pyGE_touch</em> - Tried to hack around Win32COM interface to make SketchUp respond to pyGE like script. Didn&rsquo;t workout just because we don&rsquo;t have a COM interface in SketchUp&rsquo;s API.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <em>Using the SKSocket class</em> - Though it showed some initial success the if the SKSocket was buffering and finally flushed the data all at once, this wasn&rsquo;t the best of experiences. As per the blogpost on <a href="http://touchaddict.blogspot.com/2009/06/some-changes-to-strategy.html">http://touchaddict.blogspot.com/2009/06/some-changes-to-strategy.html</a> its explianed how it worked for a while &ndash; gave me a lot of hope, but eventually failed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what finally gave some hope to move on.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Finally since the time was short, we thought of an option (with Colin) that we could connect TUIO to SketchUp using a <strong>Text file logger</strong>. got some success in getting this done. Although the disadvantage of using this method is known so as per your suggestion we&rsquo;ll <strong>skip</strong> this option for now.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> GlovePIE - the wii remote would be similar&hellip; we could create an adapter.. that would listen for osc commands and then send a message to the sketchup port with specially formatted data for it&rsquo;s lame socket implementation. It would run as a separate ruby process.. outside of sketchup. I think we rejected this option as GLOVEPIE is only for NON haptic things i.e. WII etc.</p>
<p>Thereafter Pawel suggested me to look into EventRelay and couple of other SketchUp extensions. EventRelay was really cool since it embedded the Ruby Interpreter within C++ apps <a href="http://www.sourcepole.ch/2004/1/21/embedding-ruby-in-c">http://www.sourcepole.ch/2004/1/21/embedding-ruby-in-c</a></p>
<p>Plan for the upcoming time till Midterms</p>
<p>So that should be my plan of action over the next week, so as to make a DLL outside SketchUp world that&rsquo;d take the hassles of connecting SketchUp to TUIO and henceforth prevent us from doing the thread calculation within SketchUp.</p>
<p>June 25 - June 27 -&gt; Look Deeper into EventRelay (the CPP and header files), how it works, communicate with developers etc. take notes, refine strategy</p>
<p>June 26 - June 30 -&gt; Work on implementing the C++ TUIO client within the DLL model. the SUDLL from <a href="http://labs.plugins.ro/">labs.plugins.ro</a> site etc. should be helpful. Attempt to use <strong>Win32API</strong> and how to pass values back and forth to the DLL.</p>
<p>July 1 -&gt; Prepare a SketchUp script that use the DLL. If this works then all cool, we move forward otherwise.</p>
<p>July 2 -&gt; Go do the gestures&rsquo; parsing and other parts. and later after the first evals return to the TUIO connection. As per i remember gestures won&rsquo;t be hard and the API is atleast very <strong>friendly</strong> in terms of mapping camera motions, drawing effects to other keyboard events, which in turn will be touchevents in our case.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll not be the best policy to predict my schedule more than this because things tend to get a little out of the plan, the hack might just take a little longer to work and execute.</p>
<p>Currently its my summer holidays so I spend around 7-8 hours a day on my computer trying and implementing the stuff that might or might not work, but i tend to give it my best shot. :)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around a week back while playing around with a friend, i took some photographs from my iPhone that were one of the most inseparable ones to me. Due to a stupid backup method, I happened to accidently delete and lose them in a jiffy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The odds to recovering them were low, and i took some precautions like minimally using my iPhone so that disk Read+Write sessions do not overwrite the data permanently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
